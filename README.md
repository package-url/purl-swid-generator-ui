# PURL SWID Generator (UI)

A simple webapp that provides guidance on and creates Package URLs of type "swid".

SWID is defined in [ISO-IEC 19770-2 Software Identification (SWID) tags](https://www.iso.org/standard/65666.html) and 
defines an XML Schema. Ironically, the SWID specification supports more than software identity, however, in the case of 
Package URL (which is primarily an identity and location specification) the identity portions of SWID can be leveraged 
and represented in PURL. This approach makes PURL formatted SWID more easily accessible and available to software
consumers and systems leveraging SBOM, ITAM, and SAM.

[Launch the PURL SWID Generator](https://package-url.github.io/purl-swid-generator-ui/) to learn more and generate your 
own SWID tags that are represented in Package URL format.
